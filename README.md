# DataAugmentation
Demonstration of Data Augmentation. I have used a dataset that has 5 kinds of flowers. I have built a CNN model that can identify the class of flower.

Often CNN overfits when we are covering diverse cases in image classification. Data augmentation is used to create zoomed in, zoomed out and different contrast images.
This trains the model better overcoming the problem of overfitting.
